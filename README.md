# Dis-Bored
##A fun side project made in Atom using Javascript and the Discordie API.

In order for this bot to work, you're going to need **3** things.
Node.JS
Discordie
and a GUI like Atom.

######Installation.

First, download the repository.

Make sure you have Node.JS **INSTALLED**. You need it so the bot can run.

Next open CMD as admin, and do 'npm install package.json'.

After the package is done installing open CMD as admin again.

To run the bot, do the following command: 'node bot.js'.

The bot **should** successfully start up.
